## Offensive Security Intro

"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."

Offensive security involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access. The goal is to understand hacker tactics and enhance our system defences.

Careers in offensive security:

- Penetration Tester - Responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities.
- Red Teamer - Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organization and providing feedback from an enemy's perspective.
- Security Engineer - Design, monitor, and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.

## Defensive Security Intro

Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks:

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

- User cyber security awareness
- Documenting and managing assets
- Updating and patching systems
- Setting up preventative security devices such as firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

- Vulnerabilities
- Policy violations
- Unauthorized activity
- Network intrusions

Security operations cover various tasks to ensure protection; one such task is threat intelligence.

### Threat Intelligence

In this context, intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies.

Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries, achieving a threat-informed defence.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

#### Digital Forensics

In defensive security, the focus of digital forensics is analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content. Consequently, digital forensics will focus on different areas, such as:

- File System
- System memory
- System logs
- Network logs

#### Incident Response

Incident response specifies the methodology that should be followed to handle such a case. The aim is to reduce damage and recover in the shortest time possible.

The four major phases of the incident response process are:

- Preparation
- Detection and Analysis
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Post-Incident Activity

#### Malware Analysis

**Malware** stands for malicious software. Software refers to programs, documents, and files you can save on a disk or send over the network. Malware includes many types, such as:

- A virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program.
- **Trojan Horse** is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.
- **Ransomware** is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a “ransom.”

Malware analysis aims to learn about malicious programs using various means:

- Static analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. This usually requires solid knowledge of assembly language (the processor’s instruction set, i.e., the computer’s fundamental instructions).
- Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities.

## Careers in Cyber

### Security Analyst

**Security analysts** explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures.

This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

Responsibilities

- Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
- Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
- Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

### Security Engineer

**Security engineers**'s goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

Responsibilities

- Testing and screening security measures across software
- Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
- Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

### Incident Responder

**Incident responders** respond productively and efficiently to security breaches in order to protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks..

Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.)

Responsibilities

- Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
- Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
- Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

### Digital Forensics Examiner

Their job is to use forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.

Responsibilities

- Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
- Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
- Document your findings and report on the case

### Malware Analyst

A **malware analyst**'s goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate

Responsibilities

- Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
- Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
- Document and report all the findings

### Penetration Tester

A **penetration tester**'s job is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking.

Responsibilities

- Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
- Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

### Red Teamer

**Red teamers**'s job is to test the company's detection and response capabilities.

This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organizations with mature security programs in place.

Responsibilities

- Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
- Assess organizations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
- Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
