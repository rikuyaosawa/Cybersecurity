## Overview

The **dark web** is a hidden part of the internet not indexed by regular search engines, accessed through specialized browsers like [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). It hosts both legal and illegal activities, offering anonymity but also posing risks like scams and illicit content.

## The Surface Web or Open Web

**The open web, or surface web**, is the “visible” surface layer. The so-called "visible" Internet — sites that can be found using search engines like Google and Yahoo — is just the tip of the iceberg. From a statistical standpoint, this collective of websites and data makes up under 5% of the total internet.

## The Deep Web

**The deep web** rests below the surface and accounts for approximately 90% of all websites. This would be the part of an iceberg beneath the water, much larger than the surface web. In fact, this hidden web is so large that it's impossible to discover exactly how many pages or websites are active at any one time.

Carrying on with the analogy, big search engines could be considered like fishing boats that can only "catch" websites close to the surface. Everything else, from academic journals to private databases and more illicit content, is out of reach. This deep web also includes the portion that we know as the dark web.

While many news outlets use "deep web" and "dark web" interchangeably, much of the deep portion as a whole is perfectly legal and safe. Some of the largest parts of the deep web include:

- Databases: both public and privately protected file collections that are not connected to other areas of the web, only to be searched within the database itself.
- Intranets: internal networks for enterprises, governments, and educational facilities used to communicate and control aspects privately within their organizations.

Most of these pages are kept hidden from the open web to protect user information and privacy, such as:

- Financial accounts like banking and retirement
- Email and social messaging accounts
- Private enterprise databases
- HIPPA sensitive information like medical documentation
- Legal files

## The Dark Web

**The dark web** refers to sites that are not indexed and only accessible via specialized web browsers. Significantly smaller than the tiny surface web, the dark web is considered a part of the deep web. Using our ocean and iceberg visual, the dark web would be the bottom tip of the submerged iceberg.

The dark web, however, is a very concealed portion of the deep web that few will ever interact with or even see. In other words, the deep web covers everything under the surface that's still accessible with the right software, including the dark web.

Breaking down the construction of the dark web reveals a few key layers that make it an anonymous haven:

- **No webpage indexing by surface web search engines**. Google and other popular search tools cannot discover or display results for pages within the dark web.
- **“Virtual traffic tunnels”** via a randomized network infrastructure.
- **Inaccessible by traditional browsers due to its unique registry operator**. Also, it's further hidden by various network security measures like firewalls and encryption.

## How to Access the Dark Web

The dark web was once the province of hackers, law enforcement officers, and cybercriminals. However, new technology like encryption and the anonymization browser software, **Tor**, now makes it possible for anyone to dive dark if they're interested.

[Tor (“The Onion Routing” project) ↗](https://www.torproject.org/) network browser provides users access to visit websites with the “. onion” registry operator. This browser is a service originally developed in the latter part of the 1990s by the United States Naval Research Laboratory.

It is not illegal to access the dark web. In fact, some uses are perfectly legal and support the value of the “dark web.” On the dark web, users can seek out three clear benefits from its use:

- User anonymity
- Virtually untraceable services and sites
- Ability to take illegal actions for both users and providers

## Types of Threats on the Dark Web

If you’re considering using the dark web for basic privacy purposes you might still question, “Is dark web dangerous to use?” Unfortunately, it very much can be a dangerous place to be. Below are some common threats you may face during your browsing experiences:

- Malicious software
- Government monitoring
- Scams
