Cyber security is a rapidly evolving landscape wherein malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in highly-sensitive systems, often with the intent of causing severe damage, disruption, and stealing of sensitive corporate data. To combat this evolving threat, a comprehensive approach to information security governance & regulation is necessary. Such an approach requires establishing robust policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.

By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organizations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches.

## Terminologies

-   **Governance**: Managing and directing an organization or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
-   **Regulation**: A rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm.
-   **Compliance**: The state of adhering to laws, regulations, and standards that apply to an organization or system.

## Information Security Governance

**Information security governance** represents an organization's established structure, policies, methods, and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability, and accessibility of its information assets.

Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and includes the following processes:

-   Strategy: Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organization's overall business objectives.
-   Policies and procedures: Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
-   Risk management: Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organization's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
-   Performance measurement: Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
-   Compliance: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

## Information Security Regulation

Governance and regulation are closely linked in the information security paradigm but have distinct meanings.

**Information security regulation** refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets. Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse.

Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by government agencies or other regulatory bodies.

Examples of information security regulations/standards include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and many more.

## Key Benefits

The following are the benefits of implementing governance and regulation:

-   **More Robust Security Posture**: Implementing a comprehensive security governance program and complying with relevant regulations can help an organization reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse.

-   **Increased Stakeholder Confidence**: Effective security governance and regulation can enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organization takes cyber security seriously and has implemented measures to protect sensitive data.

-   **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, can help organizations avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance.

-   **Better alignment with business objectives**: Security governance frameworks can help organizations align their information security strategies with their overall business objectives and ensure that security measures are cost-effective and contribute to the organization's success.

-   **Informed decision-making**: Security governance programs can provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make sophisticated decisions about information security risks and ensure that security measures are implemented where they are most needed.

-   **Competitive advantage**: Effective security governance and compliance with relevant regulations can provide a competitive advantage by demonstrating an organization's commitment to protecting sensitive data and enhancing stakeholder trust.

## Relevant Laws and Regulations

Following is an overview of some relevant laws and regulations:

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

-   Domain: Data Privacy & Protection
-   Description: A regulation propagated by the European Union that sets strict requirements for how organizations handle, protect, and secure the personal data of EU citizens and residents.

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

-   Domain: Healthcare
-   Description: A US-based official law to maintain the sensitivity of health-related information of citizens.

## Information Security Frameworks

The **information security framework** provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organization's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organization. This mainly includes:

-   **Policies**: A formal statement that outlines an organization's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.
-   **Standards**: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.
-   **Guidelines**: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives.
-   **Procedures**: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
-   **Baselines**: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organization or system must meet.

### Developing Governance Documents

Here are some generalized steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines, etc.

-   Identify the scope and purpose: Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.

-   Research and review: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.

-   Draft the document: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organization's goals and values.

-   Review and approval: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organizational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders.

-   Implementation and communication: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed.

-   Review and update: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

<details><summary>Example: Preparing a Password Policy</summary>

-   Define password requirements: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.

-   Define password usage guidelines: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.

## Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)

The **Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC)** framework focuses on steering the organization's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner.

GRC framework has the following three components:

---

![Components of GRC](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/99f1191333d407baaa8e786ebd0ce9c0.png)

---

-   **Governance:** Guides the organization by defining its security strategy, including policies, standards, and frameworks, and monitoring their performance.

-   **Risk Management:** Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks through controls and ongoing evaluation to ensure effectiveness.

-   **Compliance:** Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and internal policies through compliance programs, audits, and reporting.

### Developing a GRC Program - Generic Guideline

1. **Define Scope and Objectives:**
   Set program goals and scope, e.g., reducing cyber risks by 50% in 12 months for a customer data system.

2. **Conduct Risk Assessment:**
   Identify and prioritize risks, e.g., weak access controls or outdated software, and plan mitigation strategies.

3. **Develop Policies and Procedures:**
   Create guidelines like a strong password policy or access logging to guide security practices.

4. **Establish Governance Processes:**
   Form governance structures like a security committee to oversee risks, priorities, and decisions.

5. **Implement Controls:**
   Apply technical (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM) and non-technical controls (e.g., employee training).

6. **Monitor and Measure Performance:**
   Track metrics, compliance, and program effectiveness to identify improvement areas.

7. **Continuously Improve:**
   Regularly refine the program based on feedback, incidents, and changing risks, e.g., post-incident analysis.

<details><summary>Example: GRC Framework in Financial Sector</summary>

-   Governance-Related Activities: Nominate the governance level executives, and make financial-related policies such as bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering policy, financial audit policies, financial reporting, crisis management, and many more.

-   Risk Management Activities: Identify potential risks, their possible outcomes, and countermeasures such as financial fraud risks, fraudulent transactions through cyber-attack, stolen credentials through phishing, fake ATM cards, etc.

-   Compliance Activities: Take measures to meet legal requirements and industry standards such as PCI DSS, GLBA, etc. Moreover, this also includes implementing correct methods like SSL/TLS to avoid Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring automatic patch management against unpatched software, creating awareness campaigns for users to protect them from phishing attacks, and many more.

## Privacy and Data Protection

In every sector, such as financial, healthcare, government, and industry, privacy and data protection regulations are critical as they deal with citizens' **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**. Privacy regulations help ensure individuals' personal information is handled and stored responsibly and ethically. They also help to establish trust, protect personal information, and maintain regulatory compliance.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The **GDPR** is a data protection law implemented by the EU in May 2018 to protect personal data. Personal data is "_Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly_".

Key points of the law include the following:

-   Prior approval must be obtained before collecting any personal data.
-   Personal data should be kept to a minimum and only collected when necessary.
-   Adequate measures are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.

---

![GDPR](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/772ddef796e37d2c2f82c1bb9b240a36.png)

---

The law applies to all business entities that conduct business in the European Union (EU) and collect/store/process the personal data of EU residents and are required to comply. It is one of the most stringent data privacy regulations worldwide and safeguards personal data during collection.

Moreover, this also includes penalties and fines based on non-compliance in the following two tiers:

-   Tier 1: More severe violations, including unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organization's revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is higher).
-   Tier 2: Less severe violations, including data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organization's revenue or 10 million euros (whichever is higher).

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

**PCI DSS** is focused on maintaining secure card transactions and protecting against data theft and fraud. It is widely used by businesses, primarily online, for card-based transactions.

It was established by major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard & American Express). It requires strict control access to cardholder information and monitoring unauthorized access, using recommended measures such as web application firewalls and encryption.

## NIST Special Publications

### NIST 800-53

**NIST 800-53** is a publication titled "_Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and organizations_", developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, US, that provides a catalogue of security controls to protect the CIA triad of information systems.

The publication serves as a framework for organizations to assess and enhance the security and privacy of their information systems and comply with various laws, regulations, and policies. It incorporates best practices from multiple sources, including industry standards, guidelines, and international frameworks.

NIST 800-53 offers a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls that organizations can use to safeguard their operations, assets, personnel, and other organizations from various threats and risks. These include intentional attacks, unintentional errors, natural disasters, infrastructure failures, foreign intelligence activity, and privacy concerns.

NIST 800-53 Revision 5 organizes security controls into twenty families, each addressing a specific security concern category.

1. **Conduct a Discovery Process:**
   Identify and catalogue data assets, information systems, and associated threats. This includes analysing data flows, system dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Map Control Families to Assets and Hazards:**
   Align NIST 800-53 control families to the identified assets and threats to create a structured approach tailored to the organization's needs.

3. **Establish Governance and Responsibilities:**
   Develop a governance structure, assign roles, and define clear procedures for implementing and maintaining controls. Regularly monitor and evaluate all measures to ensure compliance.

4. **Implement Effective Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   Set up monitoring systems to detect security issues, conduct routine audits, and refine control implementation based on evaluations.

By following these steps, organizations can effectively implement NIST 800-53, enhance their security posture, and reduce risks.

### NIST 800-63B

**NIST Special Publication 800-63B** is a set of guidelines created by the NIST to help organizations establish effective digital identity practices.

Its primary focus is on authenticating and verifying the identities of individuals who access digital services, systems, and networks. The guidelines provide recommendations for different levels of identity assurance, ranging from basic to high assurance. They also offer advice on using authentication factors, including passwords, biometrics, and tokens, and securely managing and storing user credentials.

## Information Security Management and Compliance

Compliance refers to observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards. In IS management and compliance, we will go through two key standards.

### ISO/IEC 27001

**ISO 27001** is an internationally recognised standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organization's Information Security Management System (ISMS).

It was developed by **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** and the **International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)** and has the following core components:

-   **Scope**: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes.

-   **Information security policy**: A high-level document defining an organization's information security approach.

-   **Risk assessment**: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's information.

-   **Risk treatment**: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level.

-   **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not.

-   **Internal audit**: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively.

-   **Management review**: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals.

### Service organization Control 2 (SOC 2)

**SOC 2** is a compliance and auditing framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It evaluates the effectiveness of a company's data security using the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).

-   **Focus on Controls:**
    SOC 2 assesses the controls related to confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy in a service organization.

-   **Independent Auditing:**
    Independent auditors conduct SOC 2 audits to ensure security controls meet relevant criteria.

-   **Value of SOC 2 Reports:**
    SOC 2 reports provide stakeholders, customers, and regulators with insights into an organization's security and privacy practices. They demonstrate adequate measures to protect data and systems.

![SOC 2](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/b3ce9d297ce5934620c3686b114529d0.png)

#### Example Use Case

A cloud computing company offering infrastructure services may undergo a SOC 2 audit to show its controls for protecting customer data. The audit may include:

-   Physical and network security
-   Data encryption
-   Backup and recovery systems
-   Employee training and awareness

#### Report Outcomes:

The SOC 2 audit report evaluates the company's controls and highlights any findings or recommendations for improvement. This report can be shared with stakeholders to assure them of the organization's commitment to protecting sensitive information.

#### Planning and Undergoing a SOC 2 Audit

The following steps can be taken by an organization’s management team before and during an audit:

-   Determine the scope: This may include specific systems, processes, or locations that are relevant to the security and privacy of customer data.

-   Choose a suitable auditor: Select a qualified auditor with experience conducting SOC 2 audits for financial companies. Consider factors such as the auditor's reputation, experience, and availability.

-   Plan the audit: Work with the auditor to plan the audit, including the audit timeline, the scope of the audit, and the audit criteria.

-   Prepare for the audit: Prepare for the audit by reviewing your security and privacy controls, policies, and procedures. Identify any gaps or deficiencies and develop a plan to address them.

-   Conduct the audit: The auditor will review your controls and conduct testing to assess their effectiveness. The audit may include interviews with key personnel, documentation reviews, and controls tests.

-   Receive the audit report: Once the audit is complete, the auditor will provide a report detailing the audit results. The report may include a description of your controls, any deficiencies or gaps identified, and recommendations for improvement.
